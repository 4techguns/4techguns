(yes, I know this bio looks ugly, I need more inspiration)
# Welcome
Hey! I'm a mediocre programmer that mostly does C#, Luau, Python and JavaScript<br />
A lot of my repositories are private, but I do occasionally open them up to the public
<br /><br />
Current (public) projects I plan to release:
- None yet :pensive:

Cancelled projects (sadge):
- HFExtensions: Extension libraries to optimise the creation of HaxeFlixel games (never felt the need to finish it, but it was a pretty cool conept)
- SiliconSharp: A C# port of [Silicon](https://github.com/ribkix/si_licon) (why must C# be a statically typed language :waaa:)
- 4TechBot (old Discord bot project from 2020 that never got finished)
