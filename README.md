# :wave: Welcome!
I'm a (possibly?) growing app developer that has either huge, ambitious ideas or really crappy ones; mostly the latter \
Not fully open to be hired but my experience showcase is down below

## :technologist: Languages I know:
- :snake: Python (since 2020)
- :coffee: Java (since 2021)
- :moon: Roblox Luau (since 2021)
- :yellow_square: JavaScript (since 2021)
- :green_circle: C# (since 2022)
- :orange_square: Kotlin (since 2022)
- :blue_square: TypeScript (since 2022)

## :question: What I can do:
- Small to medium-size Discord bots
- Web development - mainly React, but in rare cases plain HTML
  - JS frameworks: Next.js, RedwoodJS
- Maybe more in the future!
